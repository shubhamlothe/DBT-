Creating Tables and Indexes.

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
 create index i_orders_onum_odate on orders(onum,odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
create unique index i_order_onum on orders(onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.
 create index i_orders_snum_onum  on orders(snum,onum);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
 create unique index i_customers_cnum_rating on customers(cnum,rating);
